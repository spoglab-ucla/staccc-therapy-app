Clinicians, speech pathologists/SLPs, and all other users may focus on just the `therapyapp.py` file as the lab can run `preprocessaudio.py` at the back end. 

Here's what a workflow looks like for the end user:
1. Run the command `python therapyapp.py` in Terminal


2. The start up screen should pop up like this <img src="https://github.com/spoglab-ucla/staccc-therapy-app/blob/main/pngfiles/welcomescreen.png" width="520">


3. Go ahead and type in the CHILD ID for the current session in the white box at the bottom.


4. Once a valid CHILD ID is entered, you can see that the child has been loaded into the system <img src="https://github.com/spoglab-ucla/staccc-therapy-app/blob/main/pngfiles/selectchild.png" width="520">


5. Pick any facility you want to try out: for example "Play the longest conversational turn" will play the specific time in your recording where the longest back-and-forth conversational turn was recorded <img src="https://github.com/spoglab-ucla/staccc-therapy-app/blob/main/pngfiles/playeg.png" width="520">


6. Once you are done playing around with the sound clips, try out our additional features like visualizing data from your recordings. Choose any plot you want to see. It should pop up like this: <img src="https://github.com/spoglab-ucla/staccc-therapy-app/blob/main/pngfiles/ploteg.png" width="520">
